# Forum "Economic Principles in Cell Physiology"

Living cells, shaped by billions of years of evolution, have developed many ways to adapt to their environment, e.g. by regulation of gene expression. But the rules of physics and chemistry enforce certain boundaries on what cells can achieve and how they can allocate their own resources. Our goal is to uncover some of these governing principles. The forum is a space for conversations about fundamental questions in cell physiology and economic principles in biology. The presentations are short, leaving ample time for discussion. If you would like to hear about upcoming sessions, please [subscribe to our email list](https://ls.kuleuven.be/cgi-bin/wa?SUBED1=PRINCIPLESCELLPHYSIOL&A=1).


## Welcome to the economic cell collective!

Since 2021, we have been organizing ourselves as a community of researchers in systems biology and related fields, and interested in fundamental questions around cell physiology, cellular growth, resource allocation, and biological thermodynamics. Our [monthly forum](https://principlescellphysiology.org/forum.html) is a place for discussing general and fundamental questions about our field. It takes place on the 1st Thursday of each month. Everybody is invited to join!
